Forget Me Not

This is a simple C# program that stores login credentials and software keys for product.
It connects to a sql database - i used SQL server 2008 r2

You will have to change the connection string in the application - my computer was called 5tr34k-pc or something similar.

SQL for the table setup can be found in the file named sqlSetup.sql
